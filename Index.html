	<h1>The Journey through UCF</h1>
	</br>
	</br>

<p>
		It all started when I first attended Valencia College and took Intro to Digital Media. 
		It just felt like the exact category I was looking for in choosing my Major that has somewhat to do with 
		technology and multi-media. Especially since my favorite classes back in highschool related in some way 
		like film production and digital design. I even got to earn certifications for Adobe and Microsoft. 
		From then on those classes are where I first learned about computer science, coding, cybersecurity, and just the digital world in general. 
		I started to hear about it more from my sister who is really into PC gaming and is very knowlegable about the technology that invovles it and relates.
		So its not so surprising how I chose this major.

		Then for the next semester, I transfered through DirectConnect and got into one of the most popular Universities in Florida. 
		It was all very new being a First-Generation student in my entire family to navigate the process of signing up for courses, finding my classes on campus, etc.
		Since I did Dual-Enrollment I already gained my Asssociates degree for general studies whch really fast paced alot of time which I sort of regret in way that I'm still not 100% sure that 
		this is my end-game passion to say the least. But I just thought atleast I'll be done with school faster so I started my bachelors path. 
		I'm not going to lie to say I was a bit disapointed finding out that my specific major is only in the downtown campus while all my friends and most of student life is at the main campus.
		However, it gives me a chance to explore downtown more and find neat coffeeshops to study. I was also a bit confused and thought that the graphic design and computer science majors tie in more with web design track for digital Media
		while game design ties in with animation more and computer science. 
		Which is why I'm kind of thinking about either swicthing or minoring in graphic design or visual arts area that I could fit in more.

		I have one of my works which can be view on the Portfolio tab which will explain my struggles I've had learning photoshop, adobe apps, and first-time learning HTML.
		I am going to polish on my web designing skills more during this upcoming summer and hopefully help me to finally decided if this path is the right one for me. 
		I know for alot more upcoming courses and internships will require me to actually knwo what i'm doing but I am still sturggling to fully undertsand on my own 
		and i just need to push my self a little it more to see if I truly like coding maybe I'll like javascript more or get skilled with basic HTML.

<h2> Developing a Portfolio</h2>

	<p> Welcome to my work, I have created so many projects over the years. However, this is the only project I could find in my old files from a while back. It is very nostalgic to me as this work was the first actual big project I had to do using photoshop for the first time ever. 
		As I go further into learning different types of mixed digital media it has helped me figure out what my strong suits and struggles are. I really enjoy the process of making any piece which reflects my efforts and hardwork. </p>
	<h3> Photoshop </h3>
	<center>
	<p> This photoshop project is my first time really creating graphics using this program. I definitely struggled trying to edit images non destructively but I understand the adjustments I should make. I did enjoy brainstorming the concept I had which was loosely inspired by the videogame Outer Worlds. So I was able to learn how to compile a few images from the internet to create a opening scene that highlights the landscape of just another space movie. </p>
