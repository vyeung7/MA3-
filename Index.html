<h2>The </br>
    Journey </br>
    so far...</h2> 
</br>
</br>
<p>
It all started when I first attended Valencia College and took Intro to Digital Media. 
It just felt like the exact category I was looking for in choosing my Major that has somewhat to do with 
technology and multi-media. Especially since my favorite classes back in highschool related in some way 
like film production and digital design. I even got to earn certification for Adobe Premiere Pro, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. 
</br>
</br>
For the next semester, I transfered through DirectConnect and got into one of the most popular Universities in Florida. 
It was all very new being a First-Generation student in my entire family to navigate the process of signing up for courses, finding my classes on campus, etc.
I'm not going to lie to say I was a bit disapointed finding out that my specific major is only in the downtown campus while all my friends and most of student life is at the main campus.
However, it gives me a chance to explore downtown more and find neat coffeeshops to study.

I have most of my saved works which can be view on the Portfolio tab which will explain my sturggles I've had learning photoshop, adobe apps, and first-time learning HTML.
I am going to polish on my web designing skills more during this upcoming summer and hopefully help me to finally decided if this path is the right one for me. 
I know for alot more upcoming courses and internships will require me to actually knwo what i'm doing but I am still sturggling to fully undertsand on my own 
and i just need to push my self a little it more to see if I truly like coding maybe I'll like javascript more or get skilled with basic HTML.
