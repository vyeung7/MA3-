<h2>The </br>
    Journey </br>
    so far...</h2> 
</br>
</br>
<p>
It all started when I first attended Valencia College and took Intro to Digital Media. 
It just felt like the exact category I was looking for in choosing my Major that has somewhat to do with 
technology and multi-media. Especially since my favorite classes back in highschool related in some way 
like film production and digital design. I even got to earn certification for Adobe Premiere Pro, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. 
</br>
</br>
For the next semester, I transfered through DirectConnect and got into one of the most popular Universities in Florida. 
It was all very new being a First-Generation student in my entire family to navigate the process of signing up for courses, finding my classes on campus, etc.
I'm not going to lie to say I was a bit disapointed finding out that my specific major is only in the downtown campus while all my friends and most of student life is at the main campus.
However, it gives me a chance to explore downtown more and find neat coffeeshops to study. 
</br>
</br>
I have most of my saved works which can be view on the Portfolio tab which will explain my sturggles I've had learning photoshop, adobe apps, and first-time learning HTML.
I am going to polish on my web designing skills more during this upcoming summer and hopefully help me to finally decided if this path is the right one for me. 
I know for alot more upcoming courses and internships will require me to actually knwo what i'm doing but I am still sturggling to fully undertsand on my own 
and i just need to push my self a little it more to see if I truly like coding maybe I'll like javascript more or get skilled with basic HTML.

<h3> Portfolio</h3>

<p> Welcome to my work, these are the projects that I created over the years. As I go further into learning different types of mixed digital media it has helped me figure out what my strong suits and struggles are. I really enjoy the process of making each piece which reflects my efforts and hardwork. </p>

	<h4> Photoshop </h4>

	<p> This photoshop project is my first time really creating graphics using this program. I definitely struggled trying to edit images non destructively but I understand the adjustments I should make. I did enjoy brainstorming the concept I had which was loosely inspired by the videogame Outer Worlds. So I was able to learn how to compile a few images from the internet to create a opening scene that highlights the landscape of just another space movie. </p>

	<h4> Inspiration </h4>
		</br>
		</br>
		<p> I enjoy editing
			</br>
			whether it be of photos or good ole' fashion home
			</br>
			videos that showcase little bits and pieces of my
			</br>
			life. Being able to capture those visions or experiences
			</br>
			is something that I always look forward to in the
			</br>
			process of making a story flow. As in my story, where
			</br>
			I decide the point of view. I look forward to communicating
			</br>
			my ideas and branching out to gain more knowledge to
			</br>
			learn more on what I can adjust and strive to do better.
			</br>
			I have listed below some artists I've gain
			</br>
			inspiration from and greatly admire.
