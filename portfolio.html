	<h1> Portfolio </h1>

	<p> Welcome to my work, these are the projects that I created this semester in DIG2000. This course really helped me figure out my strong suits and struggles but overall I enjoyed the process of making each piece. </p>

	<h4> Photoshop </h4>

	<p> This photoshop project is my first time really creating graphics using this program. I definitely struggled trying to edit images non destructively but I understand the adjustments I should make. I did enjoy brainstorming the concept I had which was loosely inspired by the videogame Outer Worlds. So I was able to learn how to compile a few images from the internet to create a opening scene that highlights the landscape of just another space movie. </p>
